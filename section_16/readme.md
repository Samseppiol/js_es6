## Generators

> A function that can be entered and exited multiple times
> Normal functions run, return a value then everything is over, it's finished.
> Generators can run some code, return a value then go right back to where it was and keep going

#### An analogy 

> Start walking to the store 

> Still walking... 

> At the store, going in with money.

> You're now going in to the store, from the sidewalk which is a totally different world, and you are taking some money with you.

> Now you're exiting the store, you are back on the sidewalk with your groceries and no money.

> You now walk home
