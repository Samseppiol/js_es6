## Arrow Functions

> Arrow functions make use of lexical this

> Super fancy term but not very complicated 

> Lexical means the placement of this term depends on where it is placed

> When using an arrow function 'this' is automatically set equal to the surrounding context. In the example in app.js, it will be equal to team or squad
